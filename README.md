U of D Mobile Development Homework 8

This is either the easiest or most difficult homework yet.

For this homework assignment, I need you to describe your intended final project to me. Include any intended data sources, sketches, and ask questions if needed.


Here is my idea for my final project: a platform for posting movie descriptions and reviews (perhaps a mini IMDB). The app would allow people to view previous reviews, trailers, movie posters, information, and ratings, and also to post their own sets of these things for movies that they would like to add.

It would require the ability to display videos and images from links, posting and displaying new content and text, and probably a host url to contain JSON info for posting and decoding for display.

Intended data sources would probably include google images and youtube links (supposing that doesn't break copyright laws) and of course user input.

So my main questions would be these: Is it doable to have a host URL for JSON info? Is it legal to pull images and videos from google and youtube? and Do you think it is very doable?
